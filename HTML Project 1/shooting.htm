     <h1>Basic Shooting Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>1. Aim your left analog stick to the direction in which you want the ball to go</h2>
    <p>Point the left analog stick to the side of the goal you think is most likely for the ball to go in</p>
    <h2>2. Press the "B" Button</h2>
      <p>Press the Red with the letter "B" on your xbox controller. Hold down "B" to get the exact amount of power that you want on the shot</p>

    <h2>3. Finesse and Chip shots</h2>
      <p>One type of shot that is very effective is the finesse shot. The finesse shot puts curve on the ball so you can curve it around the keeper from distance, or close range.</p>
      <p>To do the finesse shot, hold down the "Rb" button on the conroller which is the button just above the right trigger.</p>
      <p>Another effective shot in certain situations is the chip shot. If you are on a break and your opponents keeper rushes you, use the chip shot to float the ball over the keeper and into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>To preform the chip shot, hold down the "LB" button on the controller while you shoot.</p>
