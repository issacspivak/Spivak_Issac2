     <h1>Basic Defending Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>1. Get Good Positioning</h2>
    <p>You want to approach the defender at a good angle until you get about 1 or 2 feet away from him</p>
    <h2>2. Standing Tackle</h2>
      <p>Press the Red with the letter "B" on your xbox controller. This will make your player stretch his foot out in front of the ball to take it from him. This tackle is very reliable and is not high risk</p>

    <h2>3. Sliding Tacle</h2>
      <p>The by pressing "X" on the conroller, your defender does a slide tackle. The sliding tackle makes your defender slide on the ground with a foot out going to get the ball. This tackle is better for long range tackling. </p>

      <p> The sliding tackle should be your last resort as it is a very high risk tackle.</p>
    <h2>3. Using Strength to Your Advantage</h2>
      <p> By spamming the "B" button on your conroller while close to a weaker attacker, your defender will use his strength and shove the attacker off of the ball with his shoulder. This is sometimes called for a foul but you usually get away with is 9 out of 10 times</p>
